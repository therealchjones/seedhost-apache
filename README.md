Apache on SeedHost.eu

Configuration files for complex custom web serving without root access for SeedHost.eu dedicated hosting.

This may not be possible using SeedHost.eu shared hosting; I haven't tried. This probably isn't necessary using SeedHost.eu dedicated servers, for which it should be easier to use the root configuration rather than the workarounds here.

Documentation in this repository refers specifically to the configuration files here. More abstract documentation regarding web serving on SeedHost.eu servers is available at [the SeedHost web serving Gist](https://gist.github.com/therealchjones/4be138411e97eeda6571a035754b744e)
